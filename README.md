# Welcome to Sparkle, a Shiny Hunting tool!

This program currently is exclusive to Java (subject to change!) and thus requires Java Runtime Environment (JRE) to run.

### Install Guide:
	- Click on the green "Code" button and select "Download ZIP".
	- Unzip the folder with your extractor of choice.
	- Click on Sparkle to run the program!

This program allows you to choose from Generations 2-7, along with a variety of Shiny Hunting methods, including:
	- Random Encounters
	- Soft Resetting
	- Shiny Breeding (Generation 2)
	- Masuda Method (Generation 4 and onwards)
	- Poké Radar (Generations 4 and 6)
	- Chain Fishing (Generation 6)
	- Friend Safari (Generation 6)
	- Horde Encounters (Generation 6)
	- DexNav (Generation 6)
	- SOS Battles (Generation 7)

Other options and features include:
	- Choosing whether or not you have the Shiny Charm.
	- Choosing whether or not you are hunting on multiple systems, as well as the amount of systems.
	- Selecting any Pokémon from Generations 1-7 as your target Pokémon.

Once you have selected all of these prerequisites, the main GUI opens. The information on the GUI is as follows:
	- Encounters: Displays the number of encounters you have had with your target Pokémon.
	- +: Increments the Encounters counter by the number of systems you have entered. (by default, this is set to 1)
	- -: Decrements the Encounters counter by the number of systems you have entered. (by default, this is set to 1)
	- Odds: The odds of finding a Shiny Pokémon based on your chosen Generation and method.
	- Time Elapsed: The amount of time you have spent hunting your target Pokémon.
	- Binomial Distribution: Calculates the probability of finding the target Pokémon given the number of encounters and the odds.
	- Done!: Stops the timer, displays a congratulatory message, and disables the +, - and Done! buttons.

I hope you enjoy using the program!
